# MedHallu Detection

This directory contains code for evaluating LLM performance on the MedHallu medical hallucination detection benchmark.

## Overview

The detection evaluation pipeline assesses various LLMs' ability to distinguish between hallucinated and factual medical information across different difficulty levels.

## Dataset Access

You can access the MedHallu dataset directly from Hugging Face:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
# Login using e.g. `huggingface-cli login` to access this dataset
ds = load_dataset("UTAustin-AIHealth/MedHallu", "pqa_labeled")
```

## Files

- `detection_vllm_notsurecase.py` - Script for evaluating LLMs with a "not sure" option
- `detect_llm_advcase.py` - Existing hallucination-focused adversarial evaluation script
- `detect_llm_guideline_cases.py` - Evaluates whether LLMs can distinguish guideline-concordant source cases from guideline-violating near-miss cases
- `bidirectional_checking.py` - Utility for comparing semantic similarity between answers
- `Mesh.py` - Tool for analyzing MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) categories

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- vLLM
- Transformers
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- MeSH XML file (for `Mesh.py`)

## Setup

### File Paths

Replace the following placeholders in `detection_vllm_notsurecase.py`:

```python
df_path = "YOUR_DATASET_PATH"  # Line 304
csv_path = "YOUR_RESULTS_PATH"  # Line 305
```

For `bidirectional_checking.py`:

```python
input_file = "YOUR_INPUT_FILE_PATH"  # Line 143
output_file = "YOUR_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH"  # Line 144
```

For `Mesh.py`:

```python
mesh_xml_file = './desc2025.xml'  # Line 13
```

### Model Configuration

You can customize the list of models to evaluate in `detection_vllm_notsurecase.py`:

```python
models = [
    {'type': 'hf', 'model_name': 'm42-health/Llama3-Med42-8B'},
    # ... other models
]  # Lines 307-320
```

## Running Evaluation

### Main Evaluation

To run the main evaluation script:

```bash
python detection_vllm_notsurecase.py
```

This will:
1. Load the MedHallu dataset
2. Evaluate each model with and without domain knowledge
3. Calculate performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score)
4. Save results to the specified CSV file

To evaluate guideline-concordant source cases against adversarial near-miss cases:

```bash
python detect_llm_guideline_cases.py \
    --adversarial-path ../guideline_policy/sample_vignette_adv.json \
    --predictions-csv ../guideline_policy/guideline_case_predictions.csv \
    --results-csv ../guideline_policy/guideline_case_results.csv
```

By default, this script reads both the concordant `source_case` entries and the discordant `challenging_examples` entries from the adversarial file. Use `--groundtruth-path` only if you want to override the concordant cases with a separate source vignette file.

This script uses the structured guideline rules as the reference standard, judges each vignette together with its proposed actions, and reports both per-example predictions and summary metrics for the three configured LLMs.

### Bidirectional Checking

To analyze semantic similarity between hallucinated and ground truth answers:

```bash
python bidirectional_checking.py
```

### MeSH Analysis

To analyze MeSH categories in the dataset:

```bash
python Mesh.py
```
Note: You'll need to download the MeSH XML file separately.

## Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation provides:
- Overall precision, recall, and F1 scores
- Performance breakdown by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
- Metrics with and without access to medical knowledge
- Percentage of "not sure" responses when available

## Model Support

The detection script supports:
- Hugging Face models via vLLM
- OpenAI models (when configured with API key)
